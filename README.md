# Google-Certificate-Portfolio
Documentation of the notes, labs, and activities completed throughout my Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. I completed this certificate between June 2024 and November 2024. I was awarded a scholarship from the Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) organization that paid for the program. 

Check out the [wiki page](https://github.com/savannahc502/Google-Certificate-Portfolio/wiki) for more details and notes about what I learned, and portfolio showcase items demonstrating my learning.
